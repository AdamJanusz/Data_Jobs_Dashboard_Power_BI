# My Power BI Dashboard Portfolio 

This repository contains a collection of Power BI dashboards I have created. Each project showcases how I transformed raw data into interactive and insightful visual reports. The dashboards highlight various techniques such as data cleaning, modeling, DAX calculations, and advanced report design. Whether you're exploring job market trends or business performance metrics, these projects demonstrate my ability to turn data into actionable insights through compelling visual storytelling.

# Featured Dashboards
